    abstract = {Abstract In this study, we present a bottomside model representation to be used by the Empirical Canadian High Arctic Ionospheric Model (E-CHAIM). This model features a new approach to modeling the bottomside electron density; namely, instead of modelling electron density directly, E-CHAIM models the altitude profile of the scale thickness of a single bottomside layer. In this approach, the curvature in the bottomside associated with the E region and F1 layer is represented in the scale thickness domain as a peak function centered at the layer peak altitude. The use of this approach ensures the production of explicitly doubly differentiable bottomside electron density profiles and directly avoids issues known to exist within current standards, such as the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI), which has discontinuities in space, time, and in the vertical electron density gradient. In terms of performance, after removing the impacts of hmF2 and NmF2, the new E-CHAIM profile function generally performs comparably to the IRI, with bottomside TEC from both models within 2.0 TECU (1 TECU = 1016 e/m3) of observations. More specifically, the E-CHAIM bottomside is demonstrated to outperform the IRI bottomside function in the F region during low solar activity periods with respect to incoherent scatter radar observations. At high latitudes, E-CHAIM tends to outperform the IRI during winter months by between 10\% and 40\% of NmF2 while being outperformed by the IRI by between 10\% and 25\% of NmF2 during summer periods, mainly during the daytime at high solar activity.},

    abstract = {Abstract We present here the Empirical Canadian High Arctic Ionospheric Model (E-CHAIM) quiet NmF2, perturbation NmF2, and quiet hmF2 models. These models provide peak ionospheric characteristics for a domain above 50°N geomagnetic latitude. Model fitting is undertaken using all available ionosonde and radio occultation electron density data, constituting a data set of over 28 million observations. A comprehensive validation of the model is undertaken, and performance is compared to that of the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI). In the case of the quiet NmF2 model, the E-CHAIM model provides a systematic improvement over the IRI Union Radio Scientifique Internationale maps. At all stations within the polar cap, we see drastic RMS error improvements over the IRI by up to 1.3 MHz in critical frequency (up to 60\% in NmF2). These improvements occur primarily during equinox periods and at low solar activities, decreasing somewhat as one tends to lower latitudes. Qualitatively, the E-CHAIM is capable of representing auroral enhancements in NmF2, as well as the location and extent of the main ionospheric trough, not reproduced by the IRI. The included NmF2 storm model demonstrates improvements over the IRI by up to 35\% and over the quiet time E-CHAIM model by up to 30\%. In terms of hmF2, over the validation periods used in this study, we found overall RMS errors of ~13 km for E-CHAIM, with IRI2007 overall hmF2 errors ranging between 16 km and 22 km. The E-CHAIM performs comparably to or slightly better than the IRI within the polar cap; however, significant improvements are found within the auroral oval.},

    abstract = {Abstract In this study, we present a topside model representation to be used by the Empirical Canadian High Arctic Ionospheric Model (E-CHAIM). In the process of this, we also present a comprehensive evaluation of the NeQuick's, and by extension the International Reference Ionosphere's, topside electron density model for middle and high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. Using data gathered from all available incoherent scatter radars, topside sounders, and Global Navigation Satellite System Radio Occultation satellites, we show that the current NeQuick parameterization suboptimally represents the shape of the topside electron density profile at these latitudes and performs poorly in the representation of seasonal and solar cycle variations of the topside scale thickness. Despite this, the simple, one variable, NeQuick model is a powerful tool for modeling the topside ionosphere. By refitting the parameters that define the maximum topside scale thickness and the rate of increase of the scale height within the NeQuick topside model function, r and g, respectively, and refitting the model's parameterization of the scale height at the F region peak, H0, we find considerable improvement in the NeQuick's ability to represent the topside shape and behavior. Building on these results, we present a new topside model extension of the E-CHAIM based on the revised NeQuick function. Overall, root-mean-square errors in topside electron density are improved over the traditional International Reference Ionosphere/NeQuick topside by 31\% for a new NeQuick parameterization and by 36\% for a newly proposed topside for E-CHAIM.},
